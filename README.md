# A Chicken's Window

A simple addition math game where each answer right spawns an animal.

**Disclaimer:** This project was made as a skill test in which I was to create a simple maths game in two days, emphasizing presentation and animations.

# or
pnpm run dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## How To Play

Type in your guess in the results block of the math problem.
Answer incorrectly, and you'll be given another chance to answer.
A chicken will spawn in the window with every correct guess.
How many chickens can you generate?

## About the process

You can see the [wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/yaB8KfTEUeft3t71DQDWXA/Chickens-Window?node-id=30%3A2) that I made for this project.



> You can see that the earlier versions were much more complex, but after having a UX designer look at my wireframe, we concluded it would've been too ambitious for the time I had allotted for the project.
>
> Based on her feedback, I eliminated the counting aspect I had in mind for the game and simplified the layout.
>
>  also spent time prior researching new animation techniques and technologies. I learned how to animate pixel sprites and did a shallow dive into understanding how Framer Motion would work within my project. One feature that I enjoy from Framer Motions is the ability to set state within the animation divs! How awesome is that?
