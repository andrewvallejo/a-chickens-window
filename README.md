## Special Thanks

I would like to thank Ege for providing feedback on my [wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/yaB8KfTEUeft3t71DQDWXA/Chickens-Window?node-id=30%3A2). While I wasn't aiming for perfection, Ege helped keep me grounded in my vision. I took the bare essentials and brought the pieces life with animations using Framer Motion.
